# inhibitory-connectivity

This repository contains the code for reproduction of results obtained in the report submitted for the Practical Biomedical Module,
as part of our completion of the Master of Science in Computational Neuroscience, Cognition and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Nottingham.

There are four different notebooks for reproducing figures 1, 2, 5 and 7 of the following paper [1]
